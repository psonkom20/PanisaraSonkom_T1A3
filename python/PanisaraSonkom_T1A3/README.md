## List of Features used in the applications
### 1. Select number of questions
This is the first feature user will come across when they start the game. This feature witth prompt user to input the number of questions they want and retrieve that number from the question bank. To enable this I assigned the user input (user_number_question_per_quiz) and the dictionary which hold all the questions, answer, and alternative choices to the prep_char_question function which hold the code to get an amount of item from the dictionary.
