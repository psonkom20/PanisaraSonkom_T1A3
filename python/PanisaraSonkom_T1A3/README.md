## Code Styling convention
For this python terminal application I applied the pep 8 coding style. The link below is the guideline I used for my code.

## List of Features used in the applications
### 1. Select number of questions
![Figure1-4](./Resources/fig1-1.png)
This is the first feature user will come across when they start the game. This feature with prompt user to input the number of questions they want and retrieve that number from the question bank. To enable this I assigned the user input (user_number_question_per_quiz) and the dictionary which hold all the questions, answer, and alternative choices to the prep_char_question function which hold the code to get an amount of item from the dictionary.

I also implemented error handling to this feature which will prompt user to input the number of questions they want again if their input was out of range or a string.
### 2. Countdown timer
3. Create 10 rounds
